The data was deposited on [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.hhmgqnkfr) in accordance with the journal's data archival policy. Here, we have corrected some erors and updated the data and also provide the scripts that have been further edited since the publication of the paper.

Changes to the data from the Dryad version:

* Some dates for `date.filled` and `date.of.deployment` were given as 2019 instead of 2018. These have been corrected. The variable `numDaysField` is correct as they were corrected separately.
* The variable "Batch" was missing and has now been added.
* Raw C and N values, as well as H values, from the lab report have been added to `CHNS.csv`.
